Organizing nodeschool events in Oslo, Norway!

## Events

We held our first nodeschool NYC session on September 27th, 2014 at [Finn.no](www.finn.no). [@Andersos](https://twitter.com/Andersos), the lead host and organizer, wrote a great [debrief](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues/93#issuecomment-36045066).

We'll be hosting another one soon!
